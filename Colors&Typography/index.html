            <p>
                <span>Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis.</span> It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, 
                consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and 
                Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. <span>Previously a small castle town</span>, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when Tokugawa Ieyasu 
                established his feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's largest 
                cities. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the emperor and capital moved from Kyoto to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo 
                ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and the air raids of 1945.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly <span>unlimited choice of shopping</span>, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. 
                The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. 
                Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.

            <h3 class="sensoji">Sensoji Temple</h3>
            <p>Standing proud in the heart of the traditional suburb of Asakusa sits the Buddhist Senso-ji Temple. It is one of the city’s oldest landmarks and a popular
                 destination for those wishing to learn more about the country’s rich Buddhist history. A visit to Tokyo isn’t complete without stopping by Senso-ji.

            <h2>Canberra, Australia</h2>
            <p>
                It is often thought that it is Sydney, but <span>Canberra is the real capital of Australia!</span> It is a city little known compared to the other Australian metropolises. 
                It has a rather large area of 814.2 square km, made up of numerous green spaces that make it an airy and spacious city.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span>population is about 370,000</span> inhabitants or one-tenth of that of Sydney. This makes it a rather quiet city where you 
                can enjoy your surroundings peacefully. Unlike the majority of Australian cities, Canberra is inland. This results in a climate 
                characterised by hot summers and cold winters. However, the sea and the mountains are just a two-hour drive from the capital.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>The best season to visit Canberra is probably February</span>, but the city offers numerous events and events 
                throughout the year. For locals living in Canberra, it is a privilege, and they consider the capital as one of the best cities in the world to reside in. 
                The city was born following a long debate between Sydney and Melbourne concerning the granting of capital status. Today, it is actually considered by many 
                to be one of the best-designed and organized cities in the world.

            <h3>Cologne Cathedral</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The official name of this monument of Gothic architecture is the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Mary. It is located on the Cathedral Hill in Cologne. The history of the monument begins in the 1st century AD, when the first temple was built on this site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The building of the cathedral that residents and guests of Cologne can see today began in the middle of the 13th century. The local archbishop was given the relics of the Magi — the kings who brought gifts to the newborn Jesus. The city authorities decided to build a temple in honor of this, but the construction was delayed for several centuries. The first stone was laid in 1248, and construction was finished only 632 years later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The facade of the Cologne Cathedral is recognized as the largest in the world — almost 145 m long, 157 m high and 86.5 m wide. It is decorated with towers, columns, pilasters, statues of saints and other interior details decorated with gild and mosaics. The main relics of the cathedral, apart from the shrine with the relics of the Magi, are the oak cross with the crucified Christ and the staff of St. Peter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cathedral is located in the very center of the city, so you can easily get to it. You can get to the Hauptbanhof stop by trams No. 5, 16, 18 or the elevated metro — the city train. Buses No. 124, 132, 133 and 26 run from the railway station.

            <h2>Berlin, Germany</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Germany is a country located in the heart of Western Europe. It is bordered by Denmark, Poland, Czechia, Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. Germany has a strategic location on the North European Plain and along the entrance to the Baltic Sea. The government system is a federal republic; the chief of state is the president, and the head of government is the chancellor. Germany has a mixed economic system which includes a variety of private freedom, combined with centralized economic planning and government regulation. Germany is a member of the European Union (EU).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Achieving national unity later than other European nations, Germany quickly caught up economically and militarily, before defeats in World War One and World War Two left it shattered, facing the difficult legacy of Nazism and divided between Europe's Cold War blocs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 1949, West Germany rebounded to become the continent's economic giant and a prime mover of European cooperation. Franco-German cooperation was central to European economic integration in the 1980s and 1990s.

                <h3>Berlin Wall</h3>
                <p>
                    The Berlin Wall is another significant historical site that should be on your must-visit list. This concrete barrier once divided the city into East and West Berlin. Although most of the wall has been demolished, some sections and memorial sites remain as a reminder of the city’s turbulent past. Visit the East Side Gallery, where you can see colorful murals painted on the remaining stretch of the wall.
